    <h3>Steven wants to build a very simple tip calculator for whenever he goes eating in a 
        restaurant. In his country, it's usual to tip 15% if the bill value is between 50 and 
        300. If the value is different, the tip is 20%</h3>
    <ul>
        <li> Calculate the tip, depending on the bill value. Create a variable called 'tip' for 
            this. It's not allowed to use an if/else statement � (If it's easier for you, you can 
            start with an if/else statement, and then try to convert it to a ternary 
            operator!)</li>
        <li> Print a string to the console containing the bill value, the tip, and the final value 
            (bill + tip). Example: “The bill was 275, the tip was 41.25, and the total value 
            316.25”</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>test data:</h3>
    <p> Data 1: Test for bill values 275, 40 and 430</p>
    <h3>Hints:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li> To calculate 20% of a value, simply multiply it by 20/100 = 0.2</li>
        <li> Value X is between 50 and 300, if it's >= 50 && <= 300</li>
    </ul>
